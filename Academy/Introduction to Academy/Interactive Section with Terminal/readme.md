# Interactive Section with Terminal

------

This `Interactive Section` also includes a Linux instance.

You can use the instance directly from below or click `Full Screen` to open a full-screen instance in a new browser window.

On the top left part of the instance window, you will see a few icons. The one you will find yourself using the most is the `bash` terminal.

Follow the steps below to complete this exercise.

1. Click the `Start Instance` button

2. Try to locate the

    

   ```bash
   bash
   ```

    

   terminal icon and click it!

   - *Hint: Look for the icons in the top-left section of the instance.*

3. Type

    

   ```
   uname -a
   ```

    

   and press Enter in the terminal window.

   - *Tip: This will return some useful information about the specific flavor of the OS and its kernel.*

```shell-session
[user1@htb]$ uname -a
...
```

Based on the commands you executed, what is likely to be the operating system flavor of this instance? (case-sensitive)
