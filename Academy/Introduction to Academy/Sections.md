# Sections

------

`Sections` are the smallest learning block in Academy.

We can assume that each `Section` is a page in a book, and the book itself is a `Module`.

For example, your current `Module` is **Introduction to Academy** and your current `Section` is **Sections**.

------

## Table of Contents

You can easily navigate to the section you want via the `Table of Contents` on the right side. Your current section is always highlighted. We strongly recommend following the sections in the order that they appear.

------

## My Workstation

My Workstation is a Linux operating system (Parrot OS), pre-packed with many tools to assist you in the learning process. You can spawn it anytime from the right side menu to practice any material you are learning, and, in certain sections, you will use it to solve exercises.

## Interactive Sections

You will notice that some `Sections` have a small cube icon () next to them! We call these `Interactive Sections` and require one or more answers from you to complete. These `Interactive Sections` will sometimes also require the use of `My Workstation`.

By answering questions in `Interactive Sections` you are rewarded with `Cubes`. You can use these `Cubes` to unlock other modules and content in the Academy.

Click `Mark Complete and Next` to try your first `Interactive Section`.
